# Session replay's short movie tutorial 


Have you ever wondered if it's possible to detect [application](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/real-user-monitoring/basic-concepts/applications) flaws in a split second? 
>It's now possible with the [Session Replay](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/real-user-monitoring/basic-concepts/session-replay) feature, which is a  video recording from the entire [user session](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/real-user-monitoring/basic-concepts/user-session), formed as a sequence of [user actions](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/real-user-monitoring/basic-concepts/user-actions), designed for error analysis.
>>Find out how it works. Discover the functionality in only 6 steps and capture any types of issues in less than 5 minutes.

  ## **Example scenario**
  >Imagine an online shop, www.performancewear.com,  selling clothing and accessories through a single-page application running on Amazon AWS.
  
  ## **Problem**
  >Ashley is a client who was trying to place her order via website form but was unable to complete her transaction. After filling in a few fields, she found out that the system  froze and remained unresponsible despite corrections and webpage reloads. 
  
 ## **Approach**
  >The Dynatrace platform's user-friendly, [AI-powered dashboard](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/dashboards-and-charts) identifies issues within application. However, the user action that led to an error does not explain what exactly happened. Session replay, in turn, enables the user to retrieve all steps taken by Ashley and find out why the application froze.
  
  ## **Outcome**
 >Inefficiencies are determined and mitigated.


 
## **Recommended steps**

 **__Step 1. CHECK THE DASHBOARD__**. 
 >Check the Dynatrace dashboard for open issues and deviations. You can see critical areas organized into themed cards, including:
 * [Problems](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/problem-detection-and-analysis)
 * [Smartscape](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/smartscape), with the number of Processes
 * Applications affected
 * [Synthetic monitors](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/synthetic-monitoring)
 * [Databases'](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/databases) condition
 * Application performance with [Apdex rating](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/real-user-monitoring/basic-concepts/ratings/apdex-ratings), the number of JavaScript errors per minute,  and a graph illustrating user actions per minute, including
 [Load actions](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/real-user-monitoring/basic-concepts/user-actions#load-action), 
  [XNR actions](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/real-user-monitoring/basic-concepts/user-actions#xhr-action)
  and [Custom actions](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/real-user-monitoring/basic-concepts/user-actions#custom-action)
 * Goal performance, featuring Conversion rate for your [Conversion goals](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/real-user-monitoring/how-to-use-real-user-monitoring/web-applications/define-conversion-goals) and the number of Completions
 * Apdex performance 
 * Services (Web, Messaging, RMI/Custom)

 **In the example below, a particular problem and a sudden drop in conversion rate were identified (marked in red)**

**__Step 2. INVESTIGATE OPEN ISSUES__**. 
>By clicking on the **Problems** icon, you are transferred to the error details screen. It can be figured out what exact item is affected (for example, the drill-down functionality, and the impact area, such as main page). Other information include:
* the error table with a split into application, services and infrastucture as per the pattern below:

| Items        |      Affected | Recovered| Monitored|
|------------  |:-------------:|------:   |------:   |
|Application   |       1       |   -      |    24    |
|Service       |       0       |   -      |    92    |
|Infrastructure|       0       |   12     |    46    |

* business impact analysis, showing how many users are impacted:

 **__Step 3. FIND THE ERROR/S__** 
 >By drilling this issue further down, you can learn what the exact type of issue was encountered, such as JavaScript error increase.

 >You can also compare JavaScript errors with user actions on a timeline:

 >Scroll down to **Top 10 JavaScript errors** table to find out new, unknown and high-frequency errors, such as the one marked in red:

 **__Step 4. FIND THE USER__** 
 >By clicking on the **View Full Details** button on the right bottom of the Top 10 JavaScript table, you can view such error details as page occurence, error message, stacktrace and an **exact user action that caused the issue**.

 **__NOTE:__** Since www.performancewear.com a single-page application, you don't know where the command "click on 'btn_sell-421198' " was executed and what actions it was meant to take. In such scenario, the search by a particular user can be performed by returning to the **Business impact analysis** icon and clicking on the **Number of impacted users**:

  **__Step 5. REPLAY THE SESSION__**
  
  >Find and select the user who raised the issue on the list ![screenshot](https://github.com/AnnaRyb/Screenshots/blob/main/user%20search.png)
  
  >Find the session affected and replay the session![screenshot](https://github.com/AnnaRyb/Screenshots/blob/main/Replay%20button.png) 


 **__Step 6. DETERMINE THE ERROR SPECIFICS__**
 >In the user's session's recording, you can find the exact moment and field where issue occurred:
 ![screenshot](https://github.com/AnnaRyb/Screenshots/blob/main/Postal%20code.png) 
 
 >In this case, Ashley inserted her postal code in an invalid format for the selected country field, prompting a loading indicator that did not dissappear and blocked user to advance to the next step. The recording shows Ashley's numerous attemps to continue after correcting the code, then filling in the form again, and finally quitting the application.
 >  Session Replay's short movie is the best illustration of customer journey, with every step she/he takes before and after an incident happens.
