# scan  with an eagle-eyed error detection tool
# observe 

Have you ever wondered if it is possible to detect application flaws in a split second? It is now possible with the Session Replay feature.
This is how it works

  Example scenario
  Imagine an online shop, www.performancewear.com that sells clothing and accessories through a single-page application running on Amazon AWS.
  
  Problem
  Ashley is a client who was trying to place her order via website form but was unable to complete her transaction. After filling in a few fields, she found out that the system  froze and remained unresponsible despite correct information was populated. 
  
  Approach
  The Dynatrace platform's user-friendly, AI-powered dashboard replays all steps taken by Ashley and detects suspicious behavior. 
  Outcome
 Inefficiences are determined and mitigated.
 
As a user, you might need to perform certain steps to precisely determine the cause of failure and repair it immediately.
 Step 1. Check the Dynatrace dashboard for  open issues and deviations, such as sudden drop in conversion rate. You can see them

Step 2. By clicking the issue icon, you are moved to the error details screen. It can be figured out easily what exact item is affected (for example, the drill-down functionality, and the impact area, such as main page). Other information include:
       the exact type of error (such as JavaScript error)
       the error map with a split into application, services and infrastucter as per below pattern

| Tables       |      Affected | Recovered| Monitored|
|---------  -  |:-------------:|------:   |------:   |
|Application   |       1       | $1600    |3456789   |
|Service       |       0       |   $12    |567892    |
|Infrastructure|       0       |6789023   |51114678  |
